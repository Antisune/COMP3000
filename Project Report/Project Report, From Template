Eric Romano and Samuel Whitty

1. Intro
1.1 Context
-Review of background concepts
1.2 Problem Statement
-Goals, achievements, relevancies, motivations
1.3 Result
-Achievement of events defined in Problem Statement
1.4 Outline
-Outline the content of the report by the corresponding section's number
-Generic statements about each section

2. Background Information
-Previous works that are being built upon, sources, diagrams, etc.
-Cite sources that don't relate to classwork
-Generally stick to concepts not addressed in class, overlap is fine when there is a relationship

3. Result
-Describe work that has been achieved
-Review the interface with use cases
	-Include screenshots for better understanding of output
-Inclusion of UML shows an understanding of the systems
-All claims need be supported with evidence
	-Efficiency, Improvement over a previous system, etcetera
-*Any figures must be created, not taken/referenced
	-Figures must have a caption
	-Elements must be described
	-Aesthetically/graphically, figures must relate on the page

4. Evaluation and Quality Assurance
-Develop test cases that exercise typical execution paths of your software
	-Self-critically and honestly do all tests
-Things to test
	-Claims about improved runtimes, (not relevant)
	-Ease of use, user response
-What to Collect:
	-User responses: perform useability study
	-CPU, memory useage, delays, etcetera
	-Anything that can be collected should be
-Scenarios:
	-As many error cases as possible, ie. Catch errors in use/implementation, anything that could cause an errno
	-Build small program that checks angles of degrees on controllers
	-Build small program that
